I am currently a Student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Engineering. I love solving hard problems and creating elegant solutions.</p><img src=../img/2c46.barronfamily.jpg alt="My fraternity family"><p>I am a brother of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Delta Chi Fraternity. Pictured above is my fraternity family.</p><p>I live for solving hard problems, learning new skills, and most of all building things. My technical interests range from from end web development to cpu architectures. I get excited to build new things and optimize old things. I have been known to enjoy refactoring code to try and fully understand how something works.</p><p>Recently, I have been captured by two really interesting areas. The first is web development. The challenges associated with web development are so enormous. You have to support so many platforms and so many different technologies. I have recently jumped into trying modular Scss, mobile first, and responsive web design as well as all the other technologies that come along with those techniques. The second area I have recently become interested in is lower level system software. After taking a basic systems software class and an algorithms class I would really like to work on some OSS that is algorithms intensive, possibly something in the linux world. Open source hardware is also extremely intriguing to me but I have yet to find a good entry point</p><p>Also I would just like to take the time here to thank everyone I have met in the Pittsburgh, PA tech community. You are all awesome. I would like to especially thank Justin Reese and Ben Haskell for helping me get involved.</p><h2>Shamless Plug</h2><p>If anyone is looking for an intern for summer 2014 contact me. drewmland [at] gmail.com</p></section></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-copyright><p>Â© 2013 Drew Land</p></div><div class=footer-nav><ul><li><a href=index.html>home</a></li><li><a href=about.html>about</a></li><li><a target=_blank href=resume.pdf>resume</a></li></ul></div><div class=footer-social><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/d-land><img class=footer-social-picture src=../img/social_media/2773.github-512-black.png alt=GitHub></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/drewland_><img class=footer-social-picture src=../img/social_media/10cf.twitter-512-black.png alt=twitter></a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewland><img class=footer-social-picture src=../img/social_media/cb5b.linkedin-512-black.png alt=LinkedIn></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src=/js/d41d.scripts.js></script></body></html>
